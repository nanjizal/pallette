# Pallette

Pallette a Haxe language related resource that groups Hex colours,  
currently mostly just groupings I've found useful for my tests.  
Pallette providing colour options to plug into your experiments.  

 
### Contributions and ideas welcome

Rather than store your test colour abstract enums in your code repo, consider adding to this resource.

### Applications

Concept is not to provide extensive colour or pixel manipulation tools,  
since colour tool suites are covered extensively within a range of opensource Haxe libraries.  
Instead Pallette provide more independant Hex color pallettes, and perhaps some helpers often related to my own use.  
The concept by isolating the pallettes your can choose if needed to integrate with your choice of colour tools.  

Pallette aimed as a simple helper with finding a visual appealing pallette for your project.  

- for graph and charting tools.
- for WebGL and GL experiments.
- for Games. 
- for UI's.
